In the era of Web3 technology, cryptocurrency has emerged as a powerful force, driven by its emphasis on decentralization and innovative financial solutions. For investors, it has gained prominence as a preferred asset class due to the potential for substantial returns and the alluring concept of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), particularly when compared to traditional asset classes such as equities, bonds, and commodities.

However, these high potential returns come with inherent risks. The relative lack of regulatory oversight in the cryptocurrency market creates an environment where manipulators can exploit vulnerabilities to generate profits through tactics such as pump-and-dump schemes, wash trading, and spoofing, among other sophisticated strategies. Such manipulation can significantly impact novice investors, who may invest heavily in hopes of capitalizing on price movements before experiencing detrimental fluctuations.

To address these challenges, Coinalyzer is designed to detect market anomalies by analyzing trading pairs listed on Binance. Utilizing a range of data analytics techniques and methodologies, Coinalyzer aims to identify potential market manipulation early, equipping investors with valuable insights into market dynamics and helping them make informed decisions.
